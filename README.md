## 🔐 Security & Safety Notes

Because this is an **educational environment**, we apply strict safeguards:

* **Main branch protection:** No direct pushes; all changes go through pull requests.
* **Code review required:** Prevents unsafe or malicious code from being merged.
* **No sensitive data:** Students are reminded never to upload credentials, passwords, or private info.
* **Safe labs:** Exercises are **sandboxed** or use **cloud free tiers**, so they won’t damage personal or school systems.
