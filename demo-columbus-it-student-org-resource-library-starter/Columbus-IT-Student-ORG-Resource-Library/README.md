# Columbus IT Student ORG – Resource Library

A student-led, faculty-supported hub for **certification prep, hands‑on labs, and career roadmaps**.  
Built to be lightweight, safe, and sustainable — **no cost** to the school.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside
- **certifications/** – Starter guides for Security+, Network+, Linux+
- **labs/** – Step‑by‑step, copy‑paste labs for Linux, Networking, Cybersecurity, Windows/AD
- **career-roadmaps/** – Paths for Cybersecurity, Cloud, and DevOps
- **docs/** – Governance, contribution, and safety policies
- **fun-learning/** – Quizzes, puzzles, flashcards, and trivia to make IT learning fun

---

## 🎯 Goals
1) Make learning **structured** and less overwhelming  
2) Put **trusted, curated** study links in one place  
3) Provide **hands‑on labs** in safe, sandboxed VMs  
4) Encourage **student collaboration** via pull requests

---

## 🧭 How Students Use This Repo
1. **Browse** the folders that match your goal (e.g., `certifications/Security+` or `labs/linux`).  
2. **Run labs in a VM** (VirtualBox/VMware/WSL). Avoid running labs on your host OS.  
3. **Track progress** by forking the repo to your account and checking off tasks.  
4. **Contribute back** improvements via pull requests (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

> **Safety first:** Do not run scanning/exploit tools on school networks or systems. Keep all security testing inside **private, isolated VMs** you control.
