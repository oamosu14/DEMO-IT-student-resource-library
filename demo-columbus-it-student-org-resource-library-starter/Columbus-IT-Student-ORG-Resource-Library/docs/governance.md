# Governance (Lightweight)

- **Maintainers** (students): review PRs, merge safe content, tag releases
- **Faculty**: optional oversight, can approve structural changes
- **Alumni**: welcome to contribute and mentor

Decisions are made by consensus among maintainers; tie-breaker is faculty advisor.
