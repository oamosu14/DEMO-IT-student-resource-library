This document outlines how the repository is managed to ensure quality, safety, and long-term usefulness for students.

## Roles and Responsibilities

**Maintainers (Student Volunteers)**  
- Review and approve pull requests (PRs) for new resources, labs, or updates.  
- Ensure contributions follow repo guidelines (formatting, safe code, no copyrighted material).  
- Tag stable versions/releases of resources.  
- Engage with the student community (answer issues, suggest improvements).  

**Faculty Advisor**  
- Provides optional oversight to ensure resources align with academic standards.  
- Approves major structural changes (e.g., repo reorganization, governance updates).  
- Acts as a tie-breaker when consensus cannot be reached among student maintainers.  

**Alumni and External Contributors**  
- Welcome to contribute guides, tips, or mentoring.  
- Contributions go through the same PR review process as students.  
- May be invited to serve as mentors or reviewers on special projects.

## Decision-Making Process
- **Consensus First:** Maintainers aim to agree collectively on changes.  
- **Minor Updates:** Typos, link fixes, or lab improvements can be merged by a single maintainer after review.  
- **Major Changes:** Structural updates or new certification tracks require at least two student maintainers’ approval, plus faculty advisor review.  
- **Tie-Breaker:** If consensus isn’t reached, the faculty advisor makes the final decision.

## Contribution Workflow
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.  
2. Submit a pull request (PR) describing the change clearly.  
3. At least one maintainer reviews the PR before merge.  
4. For code or lab scripts, automated checks (syntax/safety scans) run before approval.  
5. Once merged, branches are auto-deleted to keep the repo clean.

## Security and Safety
- No executable binaries are stored in the repo — only text-based scripts or guides.  
- Code contributions are reviewed to avoid malicious commands or unsafe practices.  
- Sensitive data (passwords, API keys, configs with real credentials) are **not allowed**.  
- Students are encouraged to test labs in safe, isolated environments (VMs, sandboxes).  

---

## Code of Conduct
All contributors are expected to follow these community standards:  
- **Respect:** Communicate professionally and respectfully to maintain a positive learning environment.  
- **Inclusivity:** Everyone is welcome regardless of background, skill level, or experience.  
- **Collaboration:** Help each other learn, review contributions constructively, and share knowledge.  
- **Integrity:** Share accurate information, give credit where due, and follow licensing and copyright rules.  
- **Accountability:** Take responsibility for your contributions and accept feedback gracefully.

## Recognition
- Student maintainers may receive recognition from the faculty advisor for their contributions (e.g., leadership mentions, LinkedIn endorsements).  
- Alumni mentors are acknowledged in release notes or repo credits.  

---

## Review Cycle
- Repo governance and structure are reviewed at the end of each semester.  
- Adjustments can be proposed via a pull request to this `governance.md`.
