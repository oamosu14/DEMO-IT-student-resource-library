- Build small LAN/WAN topologies.  
- Practice VLANs, VPNs, and wireless networks.  

## Step 4: Intermediate Growth  
- Cisco CCNP (professional networking)  
- Learn SDN (Software-Defined Networking) concepts.  
- Explore cloud networking with AWS/Azure.  

## Step 5: Career Paths  
- Network Technician → Network Engineer → Network Architect  
- Network Security → Cloud Networking → Data Center Specialist
